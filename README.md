## Agile Methodology Implementation

### Sprint Structure
- Sprint Duration: 2 weeks
- Daily Stand-ups: 15 minutes
- Sprint Planning: First day of sprint
- Sprint Review: Last day of sprint
- Sprint Retrospective: After sprint review

### User Stories
User stories will be tracked in the `docs/agile/user-stories` directory using the format:
```
As a [user type]
I want [goal]
So that [benefit]
```

### Definition of Done
- Code is written and documented
- Unit tests are written and passing
- Code review is completed
- Feature is tested in staging environment
- Documentation is updated

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables
4. Run the development servers:

   ```

## Development Guidelines

### MVC Implementation
- Models: Handle data structure and business rules
- Views: Handle presentation and user interface
- Controllers: Handle user input and coordinate between models and views

### Code Style
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Git Workflow
1. Create feature branch from develop
2. Make changes and commit
3. Create pull request
4. Code review
5. Merge to develop
